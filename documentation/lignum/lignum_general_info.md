## Metalwork
Decorative metal structures are a great way to compliment woodwork. Also polished brass trim, riveted edge detail, antique bronze foot rails, or powder-coated aluminum framing make the project more prestigious. We can incorporate just about any metal finish detail into your project.
## Stonework
Whether it’s a stone-clad hostess stand, bar, or complete kitchen or just adding a waterfall countertop with mitered joints, concrete decorative sculptures, or a stone-clad feature wall. We can fabricate and integrate stone or concrete in your woodwork project.
## Custom Lighting
Custom lighting features make for a natural premium look. But there is a lot to consider when it comes to lighting. From color codes to the skill of integrating LED lights into different types of materials. Do you want to incorporate backlit vitrines? Maybe puck light accents, backlit translucent stone, dimmable LED strips, or acrylic paneling & signage? We got you lit!
